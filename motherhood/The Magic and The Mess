# The Between-Nap Series: The Magic and the Mess
It was 8:00 AM and my little one was officially up. I felt like I'd already won the day, I had actually managed seven hours of sleep. As I yawned and cuddled my sweet girl, she was already vibrating with energy, ready to jump off the bed and start her morning sprint.

I let her down safely and wandered into the kitchen, scanning the counters for breakfast inspiration. Bananas. I figured I could make some banana pancakes.

I opened the fridge to grab the eggs, only to find that half of them were frozen (don't ask me how, I'm still figuring that one out). I mashed a banana in a bowl, added an egg, about a cup of milk, and 3/4 cup of Club wheat flour I’d brought home from my research lab last year. A teaspoon of baking powder later, and I was actually doing it. I was making some really good-looking pancakes.

I sliced some fresh strawberries on the side and strapped my daughter into her high chair, genuinely excited for her to enjoy the magic her mama made. I even took a "Before" picture. I’ve seen those flawless "Before & After" shots on Instagram, and I was fully anticipating a clean plate and a happy smile for the "After" shot to share with my family.

She looked just as excited as I was. She reached out, grabbed a pancake, and then... the "magic" took a turn.

The next thing I saw, my banana pancakes looked like strawberry pancakes. Somehow, she mashed the pancakes and strawberries together, completely changing the color, and before I could even grab my camera, the whole mess was swept onto the floor.

She started crying, ready to escape the high chair, and my high expectations had officially met toddler reality. I realized then that while I was looking for an Instagram-perfect "magic" moment, my daughter’s version of magic was simply turning golden pancakes into strawberry mush. My plans were crushed (quite literally) and there was no "After" photo for the gram, just a messy floor and a crying baby. But as I stood there, I realized one thing: the pancakes actually tasted pretty good and my stomach was full. I’ll take the win where I can get it.
