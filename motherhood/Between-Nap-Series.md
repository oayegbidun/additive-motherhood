# The Between-Nap Series: Building My Website

I sat with my computer open, heart thrumming with excitement, fingers hovering over the keys, ready to finally execute this great idea. But the moment the screen glowed to life, my little one saw her cue. I heard the unmistakable thump-thump-thump of little feet heading my way. She walked towards me, eyes wide with mischievous excitement, ready to play with the keyboard.

I tried the decoy method, handing her a wooden spoon and every toy within my reach but apparently, my laptop is the only toy she ever wanted. I had to gently move her around, offering every distraction in my arsenal, just so I could type a few sentences, let alone execute this big idea. She wailed, a sound that could shatter glass and creative flow alike. There was no way I could work in a room where she was screaming.

I picked her up, her warm weight familiar in my arms, and started the soothing ritual. Fed her. Rocked her. Sang to her. Tickled her. Made silly faces. Two hours melted away, and I had not penned down a single coherent thought. The frustration was a knot in my stomach, threatening to squash my grand plans for this website; a dream I've carried for so long.

Alas, I saw her eyelids begin to drop, her little body finally succumbing to sleep. I placed her on my back, strapped her securely behind me, and returned to my desk. In the quiet hum of the house, with her soft breathing against my back, I finally got to write this post and finish up the website I had always wanted to make.

Maybe I should call this the Between-Nap Series, because in this beautiful, chaotic season of motherhood, those precious, quiet windows are truly the only time I get to work.
