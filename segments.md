# Partitioning the Variance: The Three Segments

In quantitative genetics, we partition phenotypic variance ($V_P$) into genetic and environmental components. This site follows a similar model, documenting the three segments that define my current journey.

## 🧬 [Genetics: The Additive Component ($V_A$)]({{ site.baseurl }}/genetics/)
**The Foundation.** This is my professional portfolio. It houses my PhD research, computational scripts, and statistical models.
* *Focus:* Genomic Prediction, Linear Mixed Models, and Bioinformatics.
* [View my Code & Research Portfolio]({{ site.baseurl }}/genetics/)

## 🍼 [Motherhood: The Maternal Effect ($M$)]({{ site.baseurl }}/motherhood/)
**The Transformation.** A "spin-off" on traditional maternal effects, documenting how the $F_1$ generation is retroactively re-modeling my own phenotype and perspective.
* *Focus:* Academic parenting, adaptive productivity, and the "Inverse Maternal Effect."
* [Read the Maternal Effect Logs]({{ site.baseurl }}/motherhood/)

## 🌏 [Travel: The Environmental Variable ($V_E$)]({{ site.baseurl }}/travel/)
**The Interaction ($G \times E$).** A study in adaptation. This segment tracks the "Environmental Shift" as I navigate the logistics and learning curves of a major transition.
* *Focus:* Global mobility, cultural adaptation, and moving into new professional niches.
