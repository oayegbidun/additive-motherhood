# Additive Motherhood: Nature, Nurture, and Quantitative Genetics

Welcome! I am a PhD Student in Crop Science [Quantitative Genetics Focus] at Washington State University and a new mom. 
This space serves as a professional portfolio for my research and a personal log of my journey through the $F_1$ generation of parenthood.

### [Explore the Three Segments of this Journey]({{ site.baseurl }}/segments)

## Quantitative Genetics & Research
My academic focus lies in the statistical modeling of polygenic traits. I am particularly interested in how we partition variance to understand complex traits.

### Core Competencies:
* **Linear Mixed Models (LMM):** Estimating variance components ($V_A, V_E$) and predicting breeding values ($EBVs$).
* **Genomic Architecture:** Analyzing the polygenic nature of traits through GWAS and selection index theory.
* **Bioinformatics:** Proficient in **R** and beginner in **Python** for large-scale genomic data processing.

> **Mathematical Lens:** I view motherhood through the Breeder's Equation:
> $$R = h^2 S$$
> Where my daily Response ($R$) is a function of my academic Heritability ($h^2$) and the Selection ($S$) of the environments I choose to navigate.



## The Maternal Effect
In genetics, maternal effects describe the influence of a mother’s phenotype on her offspring's phenotype. 
## The Inverse Maternal Effect
Traditional quantitative genetics focuses on how I shape my child. Here, I document how my child shapes me—the **Inverse Maternal Effect**. 

Motherhood has been the most significant environmental shift of my life, impacting my:
* **Computational Efficiency:** Learning to code in the small windows of nap time.
* **Adaptive Capacity:** Preparing for new horizons (both personal and professional).
* **Statistical Perspective:** Seeing the beauty in the noise of a chaotic schedule.
